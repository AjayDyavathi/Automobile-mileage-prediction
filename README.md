# Automobile-mileage-prediction

This project is a part of the course "Big Data Analytics".

In this project, we analyze the data set and discover the fundamental relationships between the variables and the performance of an automobile. We'll start with a quick experimental analysis with the help of a graphical display and summary of the data. We created a linear regression model using a machine-learning pipeline to forecast the mileage of an automobile. In addition, we will conduct testing on the process underlying the study variable. Furthermore, we want to examine if we can predict how well the cars will perform based on the data we have.
